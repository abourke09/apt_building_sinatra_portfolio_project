    <h2>Apartment Building Service Request Portal</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome to the service request portal for your apartment building.
        Once you create an account, you can use this portal to send a service request
        to your building manager. Is your kitchen faucet leaky? Go ahead and enter a service
        request and your manager will address the problem for you. And just in case there
        are any changes to the problem in your apartment, you can edit and delete your
        service requests as well. </p>
